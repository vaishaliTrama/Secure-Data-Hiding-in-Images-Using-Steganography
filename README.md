# Secure-Data-Hiding-in-Images-Using-Steganography
This Python script uses OpenCV to hide a secret message inside an image by modifying pixel values. It encrypts a user-input message, saves the modified image, and allows decryption using a passcode. The message is retrieved by reversing the encoding process, ensuring only authorized users can access the hidden data.

This Python script implements a simple steganography technique using OpenCV to hide and retrieve a secret message within an image of a cat. The script first loads cat_img.jpg.webp, then takes user input for a secret message and passcode. Each character of the message is converted into its ASCII value and embedded into the pixel values of the image. The modified image is saved as encryption_image.jpg. During decryption, if the correct passcode is entered, the hidden message is extracted from the image. If the passcode is incorrect, access is denied. The program uses basic pixel manipulation for encoding and decoding.
